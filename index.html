        <h1>Superlative apps that keep things simple.</h1>
        <p>
          We believe that you can achieve the highest quality in apps when you
          maintain focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is why we create apps that solve one problem really well. Every
          button, every text, and every feature is re-considered repeatedly to
          focus on the problem we want to solve. We listen carefully to our
          users and focus on making their lives a bit easier by shipping the
          highest quality and simplicity.
        </p>
        <p>
          We strive to make apps feel so simple you would think anything is
          easy.
